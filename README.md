# AI-Powered Interview Preparation Guide

## Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Interview Preparation Guide** is an innovative LLM application designed to assist users in preparing for interviews with the help of AI. The tool leverages advanced LLM models such as OpenAI ChatModels, Anthropic's Claude ChatModels, Google's Gemini ChatModels, etc. to generate relevant interview questions, evaluate user responses, and offer constructive feedback. By combining interactive features with AI-powered evaluations, this project aims to enhance interview preparation in a highly efficient and engaging manner.

## Key Features

### 1. **Question Generation**

   - The application generates a comprehensive list of interview questions based on a user-provided query. This allows users to focus on specific areas they wish to practice and ensures that the questions are tailored to their needs.
   
### 2. **Response Evaluation**

   - After the user provides an answer to a question, the AI evaluates the response, assigning a score from 1 to 10. The system also generates valuable feedback and areas for improvement, helping users refine their responses and improve their overall interview skills.

### 3. **Speech Input & Evaluation**

   - A sophisticated and interactive feature which allows users to record their answers via speech. The recorded audio is then transcribed and evaluated by the AI, making the application more engaging and providing a seamless experience for users who prefer verbal communication.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to:

- **Enhance Interview Readiness**: Provide an interactive platform for users to practice answering interview questions in a realistic and AI-guided environment.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Enable personalized feedback on responses to help users identify strengths and areas needing improvement.
- **Improve User Engagement**: Incorporate speech recognition and evaluation, offering an immersive and dynamic interview practice experience.

## Technologies and Skills Applied

- **Generative AI**: Used to develop the question generation and response evaluation models. Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed to understand user queries and evaluate responses effectively.
- **Speech Recognition**: Integrated speech-to-text functionality to allow users to record their responses for evaluation.
- **Backend Development**: Built with Python using popular libraries such as **Streamlit** for the frontend, **OpenAI API** for generating questions and evaluating responses, and **SpeechRecognition** for handling voice inputs.
- **Frontend Development**: Designed a user-friendly interface using **Streamlit** to ensure that the application is intuitive, interactive, and easy to use.
- **Text Analytics**: Employed Deepgram Speech-To-Text(STT) API for transcribing speech and analyzing the quality of user responses.
- **Cloud Computing**: Hosted the application on cloud platforms (if applicable) to ensure scalability and accessibility from anywhere.

## How It Works

1. **Question Generation**:

   - Users input a query (e.g., "Tell me about yourself," "What are your strengths and weaknesses?").
   - The AI generates a list of related questions that the user may encounter during interviews, allowing them to prepare more effectively.

2. **Response Evaluation**:

   - The user answers the questions either by typing or speaking.
   - The AI assesses the answer using LLM models and provides a score (1-10), along with feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
   
3. **Speech Recognition**:

   - Users can choose to speak their answers instead of typing them. The speech is recorded, transcribed into text using the **SpeechRecognition** library, and then evaluated by the AI system just like a typed response.

4. **Real-Time Feedback**:

   - After each response, the application provides real-time feedback on how to improve, offering personalized tips based on the userâ€™s response quality.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Powered-Interview-Preparation-Guide.git
   cd AI-Powered-Interview-Preparation-Guide
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. The application should now be running locally at http://localhost:8501.
